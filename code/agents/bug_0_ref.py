    Reference implementation of the Bug 0 algorithm: if not in contact with an
    obstacle moves in a straight line towards the goal. If in contact with an
    obstacle moves into clockwise direction with respect to the obstacle
    boundary until we can move into the direction of the obstacle. The latter
