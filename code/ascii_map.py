    Helper function which turns an ASCII map into a description understood by
    the environment class. This description consists of a set of possible start
    and goal locations, as well as a list of polygons describing obstacles.

    txt: string containing an ASCII representation of a map. Space characters
    correspond to free space, '#' characters to obstacles, 'S' characters to a
    potential start location and 'G' characters to potential goal locations.
    scale: scale factor for the conversion from row/column indices to meters.
    aspect: aspect ratio correction -- all x-values are multiplied by this
    value.
    jitter: random, uniform noise between -jitter and jitter that is being added
    to all points to reduce the chance of unhandled degenerate cases in the
    computational geometry code.
